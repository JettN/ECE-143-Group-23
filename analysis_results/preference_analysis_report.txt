LLM PREFERENCE ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================

QUESTION 1: Prediction Difficulty Due to Personal Preference Noise
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis shows that predicting user preferences is challenging due to:

1. Balanced Distribution:
   - Model A wins: 34.9%
   - Model B wins: 34.2%
   - Ties: 30.9%
   → This near-even split suggests high variability in preferences

2. High Entropy in Model Comparisons:
   - Average normalized entropy: 0.893
   - High variability pairs: 1038
   → Personal preferences introduce significant noise

CONCLUSION: It is hard to predict which LLM models users prefer
solely based on model responses due to noise from users' personal
preference. The data shows high variability and balanced distributions,
indicating that individual preferences play a significant role.


QUESTION 2: Which LLM Models Do Users Prefer?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To answer our original question 'which LLM model do users prefer?':

Users tend to prefer models developed by OpenAI:

  - OpenAI average win rate: 0.403
  - Total OpenAI comparisons: 31,840
  - Number of OpenAI models: 9

  OpenAI Models:
    - gpt-4-1106-preview: win rate 0.551
    - gpt-3.5-turbo-0314: win rate 0.546
    - gpt-4-0125-preview: win rate 0.514
    - gpt-4-0314: win rate 0.484
    - gpt-4-0613: win rate 0.397
